# Visualizing and quantifying topics on Twitter


## Using OSINT tools and Transformers to extract topics and sentiment
Using the Blattodea tool that I helped develop during a hackathon, I retrieved the most recent tweets from Elon Musk. I then used one of [HuggingFace's](https://huggingface.co/models) pre-trained sentiment classification models and [BERTopic](https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/index.html) to extract and visualize key themes.
I have also developed an RShiny dashboard for this project to hone my interactive visualization skills.

## Note on usefulness
BERTopic can accommodate ["online topic modelling"](https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/getting_started/online/online.html) (i.e. incrementally adjusts topics with new data), and the results in this project have shown the model to be qualitatively coherent (lacking a labelled dataset, I am unable to compute the exact accuracy of clustering/classification). It would not be difficult to expand this work to a more regular, (semi-)automated pipeline to *monitor social media content* around a particular hashtag/person/theme and to extract insight or detect sudden changes. Suppose you were a news organisation looking to gauge interest in a particular recent event. Although social media isn't representative of general discourse around any given topic, taking data from Twitter, passing it through BERTopic and then setting the pipeline to regularly update the data and topics, would give you the data to assess at least some of the discussion around a theme or event. 

## Results and thoughts
(Results are analysed and visualized at greater length inside the repo's index.Rmarkdown notebook. For cleaning, EDA and modelling code, please see the Jupyter notebooks in the repo, explained in the filing system below)

### Overall usage
I have been able to extract clear and definite topics from the collected data, and the pattern of activity around key themes has been what I expected it to be. For example, Musk's opining on ending the war in Ukraine generated a larger amount of responses across the board than his other tweets. Through this project I've found that BERTopic has been extremely useful and capable of extracting information from unstructured text data, and I plan on using it in future projects. Moreover, the model was able to group topic clusters at a greater level of precision and accuracy than I had honestly expected. In the image below I show how some of the topics (the most interesting ones) have been grouped by the model and what the model tells us vs what we can infer. For an NLP project is arguably even more important than in most data science projects to combine contextual knowledge and data viz with the results: language is far more ambiguous and mysterious than numbers.
Note that the tweets analysed are all from 1st August 2022 onwards. 

### Clustering Topics

![Hierarchy of our topics of interest](fig/hierarchical_select_top.png)

Topics 29 and 9 form an understandable cluster together as there were a significant number of tweets focused on Starlink's activity in Ukraine (and its commercial activity more generally), both by Musk and his followers. 
The grouping of clusters 3 and 2 is more interesting: closer inspection of 2 revealed that it includes some tweets related to Twitter bots (something Musk has made a point of discussing openly recently), which would link it sensibly to topic 3; however some of the tweets were also referring to Tesla 'bots' (i.e. Tesla's robotics research and department). If we'd had a set of topic labels for each of these, it's very likely that BERTopic would misclassify the tweets in this particular topic. Topic two tweets range from :

| "Tesla Bot is the future of robotics ü§Ø "

to 

| "If Twitter put as much effort into botspam removal as they do into subpoenas we wouldnt have this problem in the first place"

Human language users like us can tell that these are two distinct themes. Yet I'd say that this amalgamation of is quite an understandable mistake, given the amount of words that appear across topic 2 that make it strongly related to topic 3 and others. It is possible that if we had more documents, BERTopic would've split topic 2 into another leaf. 

Towards the bottom we can also see three topics that, although not as closely aligned as the war-themed ones, still cluster together. These are all connected by the theme of rocketry, SpaceX and all of Musk's space-related endeavours. It's encouraging to see that the model was able to place these closely together. Note the next leaf that joins this particular sub-branch, topic 55, related to engines. Now, when I originally looked at this topic, I figured that the algorithm had misgrouped again and that discussions of engines must be focussed on cars. However, I was wrong and the algo was right - inspection of the tweets with this as their main topic (currently topic nr 48 in our merged data) revealed that my intuition was wrong:

| "Hi Elon  üòÄ According to  380 tankers delivered to Starbase So I would be really happy to know Will B7 performs a long duration full stack 33 engines static fire ThanksüôèüòÄ"

and

| "How certain are you on the final number of engines for Superheavy Booster"

and, a slight outlier in some sense:

| "there will be a day when there are literally 69 boosters ü§ì"

(I do enjoy points of childish levity in a dataset.) 

*Anyway*, this is another great example of BERTopic's strengths as a model.

Folders
* data - folder containing raw, processed, clean and feature data and any additional summary data generated. Also contains inferred data (i.e. tweets and their predicted sentiment; tweets and their associated topics)
* models - the fitted BERTopic model files - **NOTE** unfortunately, due to a bug in the way the models were saved, it is not possible to load them up locally on a lot of machines. However, it is possible to reproduce their creation and fitting on Google Colab, using the [Colab notebook](https://github.com/Ioana-P/IoanaFio/blob/main/content/project/twitter_sentiment_tracking/Modelling_w_BERTopic_GColab.ipynb) inside this repo
